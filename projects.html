                      Lifedrinker was a research project created during a semester long project class at Iowa State University. The aim of this project was to identify a chosen object of interest at range using a camera feed, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a tracking algorithm to assist in the detection, identification, and tracking of the target.<br><br>This solution was then implemented as a rail-mounted tactical scope attachment for a Nerf Blaster. The attachment provides the user with real-time feedback on their aim using a side mounted screen.

                      Clark is a 50 pound semi-autonomous robot running on ROS.<br><br>Clark uses a variety of sensors to determine its position, including an Xbox 360 Kinect, two cameras, a 9-axis IMU, and various other feedback sources. Clark is driven by a 6-wheel West Coast style drop center drive, giving it superb traction on most surfaces and the ability to turn in place. Built using 80/20 T-slot aluminum extrusion, Clark features a very flexible, but structurally rigid design, placing an emphasis on modularity and upgradability.

                      The MetroMegaMatrix is a large battery powered 16x40 RGB LED matrix I designed and built to use as a multi-purpose sign. The matrix can display images, patterns, and text, and is fully portable through the inclusion of a handle on top.

                      Operation Wolfnova was the name for a series of classes that I designed and taught at the Ela Area Public Library. The class revolved around a large field designed to put students and their robotics skills to the test, while also teaching them valuable teamwork and leadership skills. Students used the Lego Mindstorms platform to design their robots.
